## Projects
### 3 DOF Parallel robotic arm with an artifical vision app.
#### Forward and Inverse Kinematics, Solidworks, Python, C++, Embedded Systems, C#, OpenCV, Fusion 360.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Design, 3D printing, assembly, and coding of a 3 DOF parallel robot arm and a conveyor belt palletizer system. This system includes an artificial vision application for quality control, distinguishing between two types of objects. The printed circuit board (PCB) was designed from scratch with a modular approach, allowing for easy swapping of components in case of failure.

### Sumo Robot Car and Fuzzy Logic Controller. Third Place winner of IEEE Competition.
#### Perception data acquisition, Fuzzy Logic, Solidworks, C++, CNC, Embedded Systems.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Design, CNC milling, laser cutting, 3D printing, assembly, and coding of an autonomous battle sumo robot car, which won third place at the state-level university competition in Aguascalientes in 2023, organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Utilizing TOF sensor technology, IMU readings from a gyroscope, and a fuzzy logic controller, the robot achieved the desired response to detect presence within a specified radius, enabling it to move effectively and quickly toward its target.

### Design of an external vision system for an industrial Fanuc 6 DOF Robotic Arm. 
#### Python, OpenCV, TCP/IP protocol, Perception data acquisition, Fanuc RoboGuide Simulator.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

I had the opportunity to develop a customized vision system to automate the routine of a Fanuc M-10iA industrial robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom. I created a human-machine interface using the Custom Tkinter and OpenCV libraries to build the application frame, and the socket library to establish real-time communication with the robot's PLC computer. Additionally, I programmed in Karel (Fanuc's robotic arms language) to receive commands from the external Python application via the TCP/IP protocol. The final routine was tested in both, Fanucs's simulator and real robot execution.
